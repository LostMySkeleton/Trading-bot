{"prompt":"This is why the Curve Wars are Being Fought ->","completion":" Art by @dgenfren\n\n\nThis is part 1 of N posts detailing the Curve Wars, a competition to acquire as much CRV as possible\n This post explains what Curve is, what CRV is, what veCRV is, and why the Curve Wars are being fought\n All of this information is publicly available\n\n\nTLDR\n\nCurve Finance is a decentralized exchange for Stablecoins worth about $2B in market cap\n\n\nCRV is the governance token of Curve Finance\n\n\nCRV is valuable because it allows holders to claim 50% of Curve’s trading fees and influence the allocation of further issued CRV\n The more CRV you have now, the more CRV you stand to get in the future\n\n\nCRV is the scarce resource over which the Curve Wars are being fought\n\n\nCurve\n\nThe central UI of Curve Finance\n http:\/\/curve\nfi\n\nCurve Finance is an automated market maker (AMM) with a focus on Stablecoins\n It allows users to convert one type of asset for another with low price slippage\n For example, if you wanted to convert DAI to USDC (because USDC is redeemable for cash), you could do so via Curve’s 3pool\n Curve can also serve as a mechanism for Foreign Exchange (ForEx) of stablecoins backed by different currencies - for example, USDC and EURT\n Because $6\n6T worth of foreign currencies are exchanged per day in traditional markets, Curve can be seen to have enormous future potential as more countries embrace (or at least allow) DeFi\n\n\nLike other decentralized exchanges (DEXes), Curve accomplishes its functionality with pools of liquidity\n Users, known as liquidity providers (LPs), can submit their assets to a Curve pool, and in exchange, they receive LP tokens representing their share of the pool\n Every exchange of assets requires a small fee (around 0\n04% of the swap), denominated in one of the assets in the pool\n This fee is paid by the user making the exchange, and disbursed to the LPs in proportion to the tokens they hold\n LPs are incentivized to provide liquidity for Curve pools because they profit from the trading fees\n\n\nCRV\n\nIn addition to trading fees, certain pools provide further incentives for LPs in the form of CRV\n CRV is an ERC-20 governance token for the Curve Finance DAO, currently trading at about $5\n The initial distribution of CRV occurred in August 2020 to pre-CRV LPs, employees, investors, and so forth, with more CRV unlocking over the next 5 years\n For normal market participants, in addition to gaining CRV through LP incentives, CRV can be bought on centralized exchanges (CEXes) like Coinbase or DEXes like Uniswap\n\n\nThe Curve inflation schedule\n https:\/\/dao\ncurve\nfi\/inflation\n\nCRV by itself does not have much utility: you can hold it, sell it, or lend it, like any other DeFi asset\n Although it is a governance token, it cannot be used directly to vote on proposals\n However, once you “vote lock” your CRV to obtain veCRV, things get interesting\n\n\nveCRV\n\nveCRV stands for voting escrow CRV\n It is not a standard ERC-20 token, because it is non-transferrable - you can’t give or trade your veCRV\n Moreover, a user’s balance of veCRV decays linearly over time\n A CRV holder can choose to vote lock their CRV for up to 4 years - if they vote lock 1 CRV for 1 year, they would initially have a balance of 0\n25 veCRV; if they vote lock 1 CRV for 4 years, they would initially have a balance of 1 veCRV\n The longer you lock your CRV, the more veCRV you initially get, but your veCRV balance is constantly decreasing, unless if you choose to lock more CRV or extend your lock period\n\n\nThe Incentives of Vote Locking\n\nLet’s pause for a moment to consider the “vote lock\n” Why does this convoluted mechanism exist? Why would Curve want this, and why would CRV holders want this?\n\nFrom Curve’s perspective, vote locking causes CRV tokens to be taken out of the circulating supply for a period of time\n CRV thus becomes more scarce on the open market, which increases its price on the margin\n Furthermore, because veCRV is non-transferrable, vote-lockers are committed to their position for the duration of the lock\n This increases veCRV holders’ commitment to the protocol, both pragmatically and psychologically\n It is a self-reinforcing cycle\n\n\nWhy would CRV holders want to lock their CRV in return for veCRV? There are three concrete benefits to doing so: additional trading fees, voting, and reward boosts\n\n\nAdditional Trading Fees\n\nSince September 2020, 50% of all trading fees on Curve are distributed to veCRV holders, in proportion to their veCRV balances\n These trading fees are disbursed in the form of Curve’s 3pool LP tokens, where the 3pool consists of DAI, USDC, and USDT\n\n\nLet’s take a concrete example\n As of this writing, there are roughly 350M total veCRV\n Suppose I own 3\n5M veCRV, or 1% of total veCRV\n If Curve generated $1M in trading fees this past week, then I would be entitled to $1M * 50% * 1% = $5,000 of this\n These fees would be disbursed to me in the form of 3pool LP tokens, which I could swap for $5,000 worth of some combination of DAI, USDC, and USDT\n\n\nVoting\n\nRecall that certain Curve pools disburse rewards to LPs via CRV tokens, in addition to trading fees\n How are these CRV rewards determined? Which pool gets how much CRV? The answer lies in the gauge weights\n\n\nCRV has a total supply of 3\n03B, which means the amount of CRV in existence will asymptotically reach that number as time goes on according to some geometrically decreasing inflation schedule\n Currently, there are about 925M CRV in existence, with about 362M of that allocated to the community (i\ne\n LPs)\n About 633K CRV is emitted daily to distribute to LPs\n\n\nThis 633K CRV is split across the different Curve pools according to the pools’ gauge weights\n The larger the gauge weight, the larger proportion of the inflation that pool’s LPs receive as rewards\n For example, right now, the MIM+3crv pool has the largest gauge weight of 41\n8%\n This means that the LPs of the MIM+3crv pool should receive a combined 633K * 41\n8% = 265K of the daily CRV rewards distributed to the community\n\n\nHow are gauge weights of the various pools determined? This is where things come full circle\n Gauge weights are voted on by veCRV holders, in proportion to their veCRV balances\n Participants allocate percentages of their veCRV holdings to various pools, and the sums of the veCRV balances allocated to each pool determines their gauge weights\n\n\nThe Curve gauge weights starting 12\/30\/2021\n https:\/\/dao\ncurve\nfi\/gaugeweight\n\nWhat this means is that veCRV, and by extension CRV, is valuable because it grants the power to allocate more CRV\n If you are an LP for a particular pool, you will obviously want the CRV rewards to go to that pool\n You can then convert that CRV to veCRV and vote for the gauage weight of that pool to increase your future CRV receipts\n It is a recursive mechanism for CRV to accrue value, wherein the base layer is the trading fees that veCRV holders are entitled to\n\n\nReward Boosts\n\nThe last benefit of veCRV is just a cherry on top: it can give you a “boost” of up to 2\n5x on the pools you are LPing for\n This is another way of reinforcing the feedback loop\n The more veCRV you have, the more future CRV you stand to receive\n\n\nConclusion\n\nHow Curve works\n The blue arrows represent the feedback loop\n\n\nWe’ve now established why CRV is a valuable and scarce resource\n It can be vote-locked to be converted to veCRV\n This entitles the holder to an outstanding share of Curve’s trading fees, as well as a way of influencing the future allocation of CRV by voting on gauge weights, which determine the proportion of CRV \n This creates a feedback loop for CRV holders - the more CRV you lock, the more veCRV you get, which can be leveraged for more CRV in the future\n The more money you have, the more money you make\n\n\nThe flywheel effect has clearly taken hold here, catapulting Curve to a degree of importance to consider it one of the base layers of DeFi\n In our next post, we will detail how participants of the Curve Wars are acquiring CRV through mechanisms outside of the Curve ecosystem\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n“The Curve Wars Rage On”, by Knower\n\nHow to Value DeFi Tokens, by Bankless."}
{"prompt":"How Dopex Might Change the Curve Wars Forever ->","completion":" Previous Posts:\n\nFrom the rDPX Bull Thesis\n\nTLDR\n\nDopex is a first-of-its-kind decentralized options exchange protocol and remarkable feat of financial engineering\n\n\nIt provides Single Staking Option Vaults (SSOVs) to underwrite European-style call options settled in the underlying asset\n\n\nSSOV stakers retain their dollar value if the underlying asset price goes up; and retain the token value if the underlying asset price goes down\n In either case, they are rewarded with option premia and DPX staking rewards\n\n\nThe two tokens of the Dopex ecosystem are: DPX - a governance token with CRV-like mechanics rDPX - a rebate token with speculative “future utility” value\n\nIf Dopex launches Curve pool interest rate options, it could fundamentally change the nature of the Curve Wars\n\n\nOptions\n\nSince Dopex is a Decentralized Options protocol, we’ll quickly review how options work, focusing on European call options because that’s what DopEx currently supports\n\n\nA European call option is a financial derivative of an underlying asset\n It is a contract between the seller, or call-writer, and the buyer\n The buyer pays the seller some money (the premium)\n In return, the buyer has the right to buy the underlying asset at a specific price (the strike price) on a specific date (expiry \/ maturity) from the seller\n\n\nHere’s an example\n Let’s suppose that the price of ETH today is $3,000\n Person A buys an ETH European call option from person B with strike price $4,000 and expiry March 1, for $200\n That means that if the price of ETH is greater than $4,000 + $200 = $4,200 on March 1, Person A makes a profit\n Conversely, if the price of ETH is less than $4,200, the call-writer makes a profit\n\n\nThe payoff for buying (long) a call option\n From Investopedia\n\nThe payoff for selling (short) a call option\n From Investopedia\n\nIn general, the buyer of the call option is bullish on the underlying asset\n They think the price will go up, and are securing the right to buy it at a price cheaper than the market rate at a future date\n The seller is bearish on the underlying asset, and doesn’t think the price of the underlying will rise enough for the loss they incur on selling it to outweigh the premium\n\n\nAn option whose premium is above the strike price is “in-the-money” (ITM); an option whose premium is below the strike price is “out-of-the-money” (OTM); and an option whose premium is at the strike price is “at-the-money” (ATM)\n\n\nOptions are fairly sophisticated financial instruments, and can be combined in multi-leg trades to express complex views on the market\n They can be useful for leveraging and hedging alike, and as such, are extremely popular assets: the BTC and ETH options market did $387 billion in trading volume in 2021\n\n\nDopEx\n\nAs its name implies, Dopex is a decentralized options exchange: it allows users to buy European call options without a financial intermediary\n As of this writing, Dopex supports ETH, gOHM, GMX, DPX, and rDPX as underlying assets \n The last two of these assets are Dopex’s tokens, which we’ll describe in a later section\n Dopex is deployed on the Arbitrum L2, rather than on mainnet L1, resulting in reduced transaction fees\n\n\nThe primary mechanism that facilitates European call option buying is known as the Single Staking Option Vault (SSOV)\n\n\nSSOV\n\nA liquidity provider can lock up their asset in an SSOV for the duration of an epoch, which typically lasts a month\n When doing so, they specify the strike price at which they are locking up the asset, which begins at the money\n So for ETH, which currently trades at $3,100, the strike prices might be $3,100, $4,000, $5,000, and $6,000\n\n\nIn return for staking the asset, the LP receives two benefits during the lock-up epoch\n\n\nThey receive the premia collected on the options for their strike, in proportion to the amount of liquidity they provided\n\n\n\n\nThey receive rewards in the form of DPX tokens, in proportion to how close to ATM the strike price was\n This makes sense because the closer to ATM the strike is, the more at-risk the LP is of the option expiring ITM, resulting in option exercise\n So the LP needs to be compensated with more DPX\n\n\nAt any point during the epoch, a buyer can purchase an option from the SSOV, so long as there is sufficient liquidity of the underlying asset\n For example, if there are 10 ETH in the SSOV, and 10 ETH worth of options have been bought, then no new options may be issued\n The option price is calculated using a version of the standard Black-Scholes formula\n\n\nAt expiry, there are two possibilities: the option is ITM, or it is not\n\n\nITM Option\n\nIf an option is ITM, then a value called PnL for the entire SSOV is calculated according to the following formula:\n\nHere, Price refers to the price of the underlying asset at expiry, and the Amount refers to the number of options bought\n PnL worth of the underlying asset is taken from the SSOV, and distributed to the option buyers in proportion to the number of options they bought\n In other words, DopEx options are settled in terms of the underlying asset\n This mechanism ensures the SSOV has sufficient liquidity to service the options if they expire ITM\n\n\nExample\n\nFrom user Ax in the Dopex Discord\n\n\nSuppose you deposit 1 ETH, which is currently trading at $3,750, into a $4,000 strike option\n At expiry, the SSOV is fully utilized, meaning that all of the ETH in the vault has been used to write the call options\n The price of ETH at that point is $4,500\n\n\nThe PnL for the option corresponding to your 1 ETH will be\n\n\n\nPnL = (4500 - 4000) * 1 \/ 4500 = 0\n111111… ETH\n\nThus, 0\n1111111\n\n\n ETH will be taken from your 1 ETH contribution, and given to the option buyer\n\n\nYour loss in ETH terms is 0\n11111… ETH\n But your loss in dollar terms is $4,000 - (0\n8888\n\n * $4,500) = $0\n\n\nAnd, you receive the DPX rewards, as well as the premia paid for the options by the buyers\n\n\nATM \/ OTM option\n\nIf the option expires ATM or OTM, then the option is not exercised\n Thus, you retain all of the underlying assets you staked, and reap both the premia paid on the options, as well as the DPX yield rewards\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nSSOVs may provide an attractive proposition for stakers\n If the value of the underlying asset goes up, you are guaranteed to retain the notional USD value of the asset at expiry\n If the value of the underlying asset goes down, then you are guaranteed to retain the full quantity of the token you deposited\n In either case, you will receive both premia and DPX farming rewards\n This dynamic results from the division by Price in the PnL formula, which does not exist for standard equity-based options\n\n\nOn the other side, users may want to use Dopex to buy calls if they want to place a leveraged bet on an asset they are bullish on\n\n\nDopex provides some useful charts that display the potential returns for buyers and stakers, inclusive of premia and farming rewards:\n\nFor Option Buyers\n\nFor Stakers, Assuming a $2,800 Strike, Denominated in USD\n\n​​\n\nFor Stakers, Assuming a $2,800 Strike, Denominated in the Underlying Asset\n\nNote that for stakers, the utilization ratio is key: if not all of the assets in the SSOV are written for options, then the SSOV won’t collect as much premium; worse, your assets are locked until the end of the epoch, so you can’t sell your assets even if the price is tanking\n\n\nThis is where the tokenomics come into play\n\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe two tokens in the Dopex ecosystem are DPX and rDPX\n\n\nrDPX\n\nrDPX is the more confusing of the two tokens\n Its primary function is a compensatory mechanism in the case that an “Option Pool” loses value over an epoch\n\n\nOption Pools don’t yet exist on Dopex, but we can analogize them to SSOVs\n Consider the following scenario: An SSOV has 10 ETH at the beginning of an epoch, with the price of ETH at $3,000\n For whatever reason, no options are bought, and what’s worse, the price of ETH has fallen to $2,000\n The value of the SSOV at has thus decreased by $10,000, and the LPs of the SSOV had no choice because their ETH was locked\n\n\nTo make up for this, the protocol mints rDPX - the Dopex “rebate” token\n It uses a price feed from Uniswap to determine the price of rDPX, and issues 30% of the losses back to the LPs\n So in the above case, SSOV LPs would receive $3,000 back, for a net loss of only $7,000\n\n\nAs mentioned, Option Pools don’t yet exist, so rDPX isn’t used in this way today\n Furthermore, there is no supply cap to rDPX\n The question, then, is what gives rDPX value? What utility does it have? An article by Dopex gave the following three compelling answers:\n\nrDPX will be used as a fee requirement for future app layer additions to Dopex such as vaults\n Dopex will support rDPX as collateral for margin borrowing\n There will be burn mechanisms throughout the protocol to have deflationary pressure on rDPX as well\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe value of rDPX is necessarily speculative, because its uses do not exist yet\n However, by gating future Dopex functionality on rDPX, Dopex has convinced the market that the token has value - it currently trades at about $244, with a market cap of ~$200M\n One interpretation of this market cap is that the discounted future cash flows generated by the rDPX ecosystem is worth $200M\n\n\nRegardless of whether this valuation is tethered to reality, Dopex has come up with a clever mechanism for incentivizing SSOV LPs by mitigating their losses through rDPX issuance in the case that vault utilization is low\n\n\nDPX\n\nDPX is the native governance token of Dopex, with a total supply of 500,000\n Holders can stake their DPX to capture 15% of the fees generated from option purchases in the protocol, in proportion to the amount of DPX staked\n\n\nIn addition, DPX will allow holders to vote on protocol parameters, including:\n\n\n\n\n\nSSOV reward rates - which pools get further DPX rewards\n\nRebate percentages - how much SSOV LPs are compensated for net losses (currently 30%)\n\nStrike thresholds for option chains in pools\n\nCurrently, DPX trades at about $3,000, for a market cap of $515M\n\n\nFrom https:\/\/docs\ndopex\nio\/pools\/platform-flow\n\nAnalysis\n\nIf the above governance mechanisms sound familiar, they should – they are basically the same as Curve! The pattern of using governance tokens to determine which pools get more of the same governance tokens was one of the breakthrough inventions of the Curve protocol\n\n\nThe theme of recursive self-referentiality we have noted throughout our posts does not stop there\n As mentioned, there are rDPX and DPX SSOVs\n Providing liquidity to them result in rewards in rDPX and DPX, and settlement of the options they issue occurs in rDPX and DPX\n With further uses of rDPX and DPX planned down the line, Dopex may be one of the best examples of composability in DeFi\n\n\nThe Curve Wars\n\nSo far, none of what we have talked about relates to the Curve Wars\n But a recent blog post by Dopex hints at a connection\n\n\nOn Dopex’s roadmap is the implementation of interest rate options - that is, options whose underlying asset is the APY of a specific Curve Pool\n (Note that the interest rate itself is not a financial asset, so the option would have to be synthetically constructed\n) If these existed, then people could express views on which pools will garner larger gauge weights via veCRV voting by buying or selling call options on them\n\n\nWhat capital would these interest rate SSOVs consist of? Likely some combination of the LP tokens for the pool, and CRV\n SSOV stakers could lock up their LP tokens and an amount of CRV corresponding to the interest rate strike price\n Buyers would then be paid out in LP tokens and CRV depending on what the actual APY ends up being according to veCRV gauge weight voting\n\n\nThis would open up entirely new avenues of attack and defense for participants of the Curve Wars\n For example, suppose a large LP of a pool is planning on issuing a large bribe for that pool, and thereby expects veCRV votes for that pool to go up\n The LP could additionally buy a call option on the interest rate of that pool, and profit if that transpires\n Alternatively, if the LP wants to hedge the interest rate of that pool, they could deposit their LP tokens into that SSOV and write call-options\n The DPX they would earn from the SSOV could then subsequently be used to vote on DPX rewards for Dopex SSOVs\n\n\nIn other words, the Curve Wars could spur another conflict altogether - the Dopex Wars\n\n\nConclusion\n\nDopex is a remarkable feat of financial engineering\n It removes the need for a financial middleman in options writing, and features a tokenomics design that leverages the composability of DeFi\n If Curve interest rate option vaults launch, they have the potential to completely disrupt the mechanics of the Curve Wars\n\n\nSubscribe & Share\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, and would like to keep up with the latest news on on-chain culture and cryptographic capital, please subscribe and share!\n\nShare Incentivized\n\nFollow yuga\neth on Twitter\n\nThe information contained in Incentivized is not financial advice\n."}
{"prompt":"What the **** is [redacted]? ->","completion":" Previous Posts:\n\nTLDR\n\n[redacted] is an OHM fork that can be characterized as an L3 in the Curve Wars\n\n\nOHM has two principal mechanisms: Bonding issues linearly vesting OHM in return for treasury assets Staking rewards high yields in OHM, but in reality is a purely inflationary mechanism\n\n[redacted] acquires CVX and CRV through bonding, issuing BTRFLY in return\n\n\n[redacted] relies on an ethos of purposeful obfuscation to attract capital\n\n\nRecap\n\nSo far, we have covered two layers of the Curve Wars stack\n The base layer - call it L1 - is Curve Finance, with its native token CRV being the scarce resource over which the Curve Wars are fought\n The layer above that (L2) is Convex, which tries to acquire as much CRV as possible through issuance of its own tokens, CVX and cvxCRV, which possess similar dynamics to CRV itself\n\n\nAt both L1 and L2, bribes exist to incentivize voting for specific pools through the vote-escrow (ve) mechanism\n These votes translate into greater CRV\/CVX rewards, and downstream, greater liquidity in those pools\n\n\nToday, we study the layer above Convex (L3) - a layer shrouded in mystery and purposeful obfuscation\n That layer is known as [redacted]\n\n\n[redacted] is what is known as an OHM-fork: its code, and therefore its economic structure, is copied from the OHM currency, which is a project that was released previously by OlympusDAO\n Thus, we begin our exploration of [redacted] with an explanation of OHM\n\n\nOHM\n\nFrom Bankless\n\n\nIn its own words, OHM aims to be a “decentralized reserve currency”: its long term goal is to become “a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange” through economic mechanisms that are voted on by its parent DAO\n\n\nOHM has value because it is backed by a treasury of assets that also have value\n The treasury initially began with just the dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI, but has grown to encompass other types of assets, including LP tokens\n\n\nThere are two mechanisms that define OHM - bonding, and staking\n\n\nBonding\n\nBonding is the process by which OlympusDAO acquires the assets for its treasury\n It does so by issuing OHM to the user in exchange for the treasury asset\n But like its name suggests, bonding is not an immediate process: while the user relinquishes the treasury asset immediately, OlympusDAO issues the OHM gradually (linearly) over 14 days\n\n\nThis would make sense only if the user is receiving some kind of discount on the OHM itself, and indeed this is the case\n Users get more OHM from this process than they would if they exchanged OHM for the treasury asset directly via an AMM\n For example, the most recent FRAX bond had a 5\n3% discount\n\n\nOf course, for the notion of a “discount” to exist, there must be a way of computing the price of OHM relative to the price of the treasury asset - i\ne\n a liquidity pool\n This leads us to the notion of “protocol-owned liquidity\n”\n\nProtocol-Owned Liquidity\n\nSome of the treasury assets backing OHM are LP tokens involving OHM itself\n In other words, some bonds give the user OHM (gradually over 14 days) in exchange for OHM-involved LP tokens, such as FRAX-OHM LP tokens\n\n\nOf course, FRAX-OHM LP tokens just correspond to a share of the FRAX-OHM liquidity pool, which means some combination of FRAX and OHM\n Thus, the treasury backing OHM is actually in part just OHM itself\n This is what “protocol-owned liquidity” (POL) refers to, because it’s the protocol (OlympusDAO’s treasury) that owns the liquidity (OHM, via LP tokens)\n\n\nOlympusDAO’s pitch is that POL is good for OHM, because it means more OHM is locked up in OlympusDAO’s treasury, thereby decreasing OHM supply and increasing OHM price\n However, one could just as easily argue that a currency backed by itself obscures its value\n This is a similar dynamic to one we noted in Part 2, where CVX rewards are paid in cvxCRV and cvxCRV rewards are paid in CVX\n\n\nStaking\n\nHolders of OHM can also stake their OHM to receive more OHM\n As discussed previously, staking just means locking up OHM in a smart contract, and is a way of decreasing liquidity to increase price\n Staked OHM can be unstaked at any time\n\n\nEvery 8 hours, holders of staked OHM (sOHM) receive more OHM in proportion to a reward rate that is a parameter of the protocol and voted on by members of OlympusDAO (i\ne\n, holders of OHM)\n For example, if I have 1 sOHM, and the reward rate is 0\n5%, then by the end of 8 hours I should expect to have 1\n005 sOHM\n\n\nWhere does this additional OHM come from? OlympusDAO’s answer is that it comes from the revenue it brings in through bonding (and OlympusPro, although we won’t cover that here)\n The more direct answer is that it comes from thin air: staking is a purely inflationary mechanism\n This can be seen by the fact that OHM supply has increased monotonically, while OlympusDAO revenue has fluctuated wildly\n\n\nPurely inflationary OHM\n From https:\/\/dune\nxyz\/fluidsonic\/Olympus-DAO\n\nPlummeting revenue of OlympusDAO\n https:\/\/dune\nxyz\/fluidsonic\/Olympus-DAO\n\nBecause rewards accrue so frequently, the OHM-based APY is extraordinarily high: as of this writing, the OHM staking APY is 3588%\n Of course, this means little in terms of actual value if the price of OHM tanks, which it has from a high of ~$1300 in October 2021 to the current price of ~$200\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nOHM has gained significant popularity because of its high OHM-based APYs and mimetic value\n You have probably seen the (3, 3) meme on Crypto Twitter, which refers to the mutually beneficial prisoner’s dilemma payout that occurs if everyone cooperates according to an OlympusDAO white paper\n Promoting sky-high APYs and a popular meme has led to the existence of many OHM forks across different blockchains\n\n\nWhat value OHM actually has is highly questionable\n For example, OlympusDAO provides no method for redeeming OHM for its treasury assets - if you want to exchange OHM for something else, you have to do so through a DEX or CEX\n Furthermore, as has been noted by Jordi Alexander, the (3, 3) ethos of “we all win if we all stake!” makes sense only if you have no defectors across all OHM stakers\n The vector of payouts is not 2-dimensional; it is N-dimensional, where N is the number of OHM stakers\n Thus, (3, -1, -100, -50, 100, -9, …\n) is more likely, if less memeable\n\n\n[redacted]\n\nCurrent [redacted] $BTRFLY staking APY is ~190,000%\n\n\n[redacted] cartel is an OHM fork that aims to accumulate as much Curve Wars-related capital as possible\n It does so by issuing CVX and CRV bonds, and issuing its OHM-analogue token, BTFLY\n Interestingly, [redacted] also issues OHM-BTRFLY LP bonds for its own version of protocol-owned liquidity\n This is also beneficial for OlympusDAO, since it means OHM liquidity will be locked up in a treasury\n\n\nA feature that distinguishes [redacted] from OHm is that [redacted] aims to increase the value of its treasury through the yield-generating strategies that CVX and CRV offer\n The documentation notes:\n\nAs an example of one of the strategies employed, bonded Curve ecosystem tokens would be staked on Convex, yielding CVX on top of the native CRV rewards\n On a weekly basis, the rewards will be claimed and staked on Convex to convert the CRV into cvxCRV\n cvxCRV is a derivative of veCRV, which is the governance token on Curve, providing holders voting power over proposals and gauge CRV distribution\n cvxCRV holders are also entitled to usual veCRV rewards including the governance fee distribution, airdrops, a share of 10% of the Convex LPs' boosted CRV earnings and CVX tokens\n After the initial launch and a successful aggregation of Curve ecosystem tokens, other projects with similar gauge-like systems will be considered\n\n\nTo simplify - because CRV and CVX can generate additional yield in the form of CRV, CVX, and cvxCRV through the mechanisms mentioned in previous posts, there is a plausible additional avenue for the treasury backing $BTRFLY to accrue value other than by issuing bonds\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nWith OlympusDAO, high APYs and the comedic-mimetic value of (3,3) were the means by which OHM became so popular\n [redacted] also leverages high APYs, but leans more into its mysterious ethos as a way of cultivating demand\n\n\nThe most obvious example of this is its name, and usage of ████ throughout its materials\n The project invokes a similar sense of secrecy as classified government documents, lending it an air of mysterious credibility\n The message to the reader is clear: if you bond and stake your $BTRFLY, you can be in on the secret as well\n\n\nPurposeful obfuscation as a technique for generating demand has been noted as a defining characteristic of the Curve Wars\n [redacted] takes this to a new level in some of its writings\n The homepage for its documentation, “The Perennial $BTFLY thesis,” is virtually unreadable because of its conspiratorial and convoluted writing style\n Only if you had a deep understanding of the Curve Wars already would any of it make sense\n Here’s an excerpt:\n\nMaybe [REDACTED] could become something more than what the world thinks it is now\n If permitted to do so, $BTRFLY may be able to take the innovation that Convex proposed one iteration back, and then take a left, and in doing so shake up the concept of voting power\n Perhaps it could find the seat at the table it’s looking for, and in doing so find something else: a pattern that could spread outside of the Curve ecosystem\n\n\nThe information density in the above paragraph is so low that the only conclusion I can reach is that the writer was trying to make it sound confusing\n\n\nIt is reasonable to expect that [redacted] will offer some proxy mechanism for Curve and Convex voting at some point in the future given the amount of CRV and CVX it is acquiring\n In fact, Curve War figure and ETH whale Tetranonde has gone so far as to characterize [redacted] as OlympusDAO’s “Curve War Arm\n” Evidently, OlympusDAO owns about 20% of the outstanding BTRFLY, which gives them considerable influence over [redacted] governance\n\n\nConclusion\n\n[redacted] is an OHM fork that can be characterized as an L3 in the Curve Wars\n It acquires CVX and CRV through bonding, issuing BTRFLY through a linear vesting schedule in return\n BTRFLY can be staked for high APRs, which may be attractive to novices, but in reality is a purely inflationary mechanism diluting the value of BTRFLY\n While OlympusDAO relied on its comedic-mimetic (3,3) argument to proliferate OHM, [redacted] relies on a purposeful obfuscation of its workings and ethos in order to attract capital\n\n\nAlso Read\n\nSubscribe & Share\n\nShare Incentivized."}
{"prompt":"How Bribes Drive the Curve Wars ->","completion":" TLDR\n\nBribes are rewards given to gauge weight voters of specific liquidity pools\n\nBribes are a composable DeFi construct, and can be created on Curve through the Bribe tool, and Convex through Votium\n\nBribers are making a bet that the votes gained from the bribes will attract additional liquidity because of the increased CRV rewards those votes trigger\n\nThe value of this additional liquidity is worth more to the bribers than the bribes themselves\n\nThe cvxcrv pool provides an illustrative example of this dynamic, because Convex wants the cvxCRV - CRV pair to be pegged at 1\n0\n\n\nRecap\n\nIn our first post, we explained how CRV and its counterpart, veCRV, are the scarce resources over which the Curve Wars are being fought\n In our second post, we did a deep-dive into Convex, the DeFi protocol built for the sole purpose of CRV accumulation, which it accomplishes by pooling both veCRV and Curve LP tokens, and disbursing rewards through its own tokens, CVX and cvxCRV\n\n\nToday, we cover another, perhaps even more straightforward method of nudging the Curve liquidity gauges in your favor - bribes\n\n\nBribes\n\nIf you are a large LP in some Curve pools, you want the gauge weights for those pools to be weighted heavily so that more CRV rewards go to you\n Those gauge weights are determined by the votes of veCRV holders\n You only have a certain amount of veCRV, and you want to convince other veCRV holders to vote for your pools\n\n\nHow can you convince those veCRV holders to vote for your pools? One answer would be to bribe them: give them something of value if they can prove that they voted for your pool\n This is exactly what the tool created by Andre Cronje, founder of Yearn Finance, allows\n\n\nhttps:\/\/bribe\ncrv\nfinance\/\n\nThere are two sides to consider: the briber, and the bribee\n\n\nBriber\n\nThe tool allows a briber to specify the following three things:\n\nA Curve pool An ERC-20 token that the bribe will be denominated in The amount of the ERC-20 token for the bribe\n\nAnd as long as the briber’s wallet contains that amount of the token, the bribe is created\n The bribe lasts for the next active period, which begins and ends on Thursday UTC\n\n\nBribee\n\nveCRV holders who vote on Curve pools with bribes can claim those bribes in proportion to the amount of veCRV they spent on the vote\n\n\nAs an example, let’s suppose there was a 1M SPELL bribe for the MIM Curve pool for the upcoming active period\n Let’s say that a total of 1M veCRV votes were cast for the MIM Curve pool, and of those 1M, 10K were your votes\n That would mean you would be able to claim 10K SPELL during the next active period for your cast votes\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhy do bribes exist? Because bribers want to incentivize veCRV holders to vote for certain pools\n Why do they want veCRV votes to go to certain pools? There are two principal reasons for this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bribers are large LPs in those pools, and want to maximize the amount of CRV they receive in LP rewards, OR\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bribers want to attract large LPs to those pools\n This can be the case for cryptocurrency projects that are starting out and “liquidity mining”: the bribers want to create large, tradeable pools of their cryptocurrency so that: It’s value relative to assets is clear, AND It becomes widely available in the crypto ecosystem\n\n\n\n\nThe briber is making a bet that the cost of the bribe they spend will ultimately be less than the value they accrue in the form of greater liquidity in that pool, and the additional CRV LP rewards they may receive from being an LP\n\n\nIf we wanted to make this a bit more formal –\n\nLet B be the value of the bribe\n\nLet A be a random variable constituting the additional liquidity that the bribe incentivizes\n\nLet C be a random variable constituting the additional CRV rewards from the veCRV votes that the bribe incentivizes\n\nLet U be the briber’s utility function\n\nLet EV denote expected value\n\nThen the briber must hold the following belief:\n\nU(B) < U(EV(A && C))\n\nVotium\n\nOne lesson we learned in the previous post is that the composability of DeFi makes it relatively easy to build similar constructs on top of each other\n Just as vote-escrowed-CRV is used to vote on Curve gauge weights, vote-locked CVX can be used to vote on Convex gauge weights\n\n\nSo, it should come as no surprise that there is a bribing platform for Convex, just as there is for Curve\n This is Votium\n\n\nThe Votium UI\n\n\nhttps:\/\/votium\napp\/\n\nVotium works much the same way that the Curve Bribe tool works\n Bribers can specify a Curve pool, a token, and an amount to be distributed to vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) holders who vote for those pools\n For example, currently, there is an incentive of 48,733 CVX which is the equivalent of $1,862,087\n93, for voters of the cvxcrv pool\n\n\nOne additional feature that Votium provides is vote delegation: you can assign your vlCVX to Votium, and it will do the voting for you\n According to the documentation, Votium “will try to vote for incentives optimally, giving vlCVX holders the best returns\n” Even if you delegate your votes to Votium, you always have the option of overriding them during any given epoch, so this seems like a relatively low-risk option\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nIt’s interesting that one of the largest current bribes is for the cvxcrv pool\n The cvxcrv pool is the liquidity pool for the cvxCRV - CRV pair, meaning it defines the value relationship between cvxCRV and CRV and allows users to swap between the two\n From our last post, we know that cvxCRV is just CRV that has been deposited (irreversibly) to Convex\n Convex gains veCRV votes from this, and in return, the user gets additional rewards in the form of Curve 3pool LP tokens, CRV, and CVX\n\n\nCurrently, the exchange rate between CRV\/cvxCRV is 1\n0302, meaning 1 CRV costs 1\n0302 cvxCRV\n This intuitively makes sense - if CRV and cvxCRV were not roughly equal, then nobody would be incentivized to convert their CRV for cvxCRV\n\n\nHowever, the cvxcrv pool is heavily imbalanced: while there are 35\n2M cvxCRV in the pool, there are only 12\n3M CRV in the pool:\n\nCurve uses the StableSwap algorithm to ensure that prices are relatively immobile even under conditions like this when there is way more supply of one token than the other\n However, if it used a constant-product algorithm, the prices would be very dislocated - CRV would be worth much more than cvxCRV\n\n\nThis gives us insight into the original bribe\n Why would someone reward the voters of the cvxCRV - CRV pool? Because they want that pool to receive more CRV rewards, and thereby attract more LPs to the pool\n More LPs to the pool means more CRV in the pool itself\n Who wants to make sure that there is more CRV in the pool? Why, Convex Finance itself, of course\n You can see that it was the “Convex Deployer” who created the bribe - that’s why they are paying in CVX\n\n\nIf the cvxCRV - CRV pair were to depeg from something far afield from 1\n0, this would spell disaster for Convex, because then nobody would want to trade in their CRV for cvxCRV\n Thus, Convex will pay the bribes necessary in the cvxCRV - CRV pool to motivate the injection of additional liquidity, and specifically, CRV\n\n\nConclusion\n\nBribes are a way of incentivizing voting on gauge weights, and as a second order effect, the injection of additional liquidity into pools\n This can happen just as easily at the base layer of Curve, or a layer above on Convex through Votium\n The parties giving the bribes are making a bet that the additional liquidity that this attracts because of the additional CRV rewards the votes engender, will be worth more to them than the bribe they are imparting\n\n\nAlso Read\n\nAndre Cronje’s Bribe Medium Post."}
{"prompt":"How Convex Stacked as Much CRV as Possible ->","completion":" https:\/\/www\nconvexfinance\ncom\n\nTLDR\n\nConvex is a DeFi protocol built to maximize CRV holdings\n\nIt does so by pooling Curve LP tokens and CRV together, and using it to increase future CRV earnings through veCRV boosting and gauge weight voting For users without sufficient veCRV to obtain a significant boost, it may be worth it to stake their Curve LP tokens with Convex\n\n\nCVX is a token used for rewards in Convex CVX can be vote-locked for 16 weeks to vote on how Convex will vote on Curve gauge weights\n\ncvxCRV is another token used for rewards in Convex CRV can be irreversibly converted to cvxCRV cvxCRV can be staked to receive further rewards\n\nThe interdependence of CVX and cvxCRV makes them difficult to reason about\n\nBut Convex has successfully captured ~47% of veCRV using this strategy\n\nA cheatsheet of the various tokens in the Curve\/Convex ecosystem\n\n\nRecap\n\nIn our last post, we explained how CRV and its counterpart, veCRV, are the scarce resources over which the Curve Wars are being fought\n This naturally leads to the next question: how can one acquire as much CRV as possible?\n\nThe obvious answer would be to buy it on the open market\n After all, CRV is available on CEXes like Coinbase and DEXes like Uniswap\n You might also provide liquidity to Curve pools that reward LPs with CRV\n And to compound that effect, you could vote-lock your CRV for veCRV, boost your rewards, and vote on the gauge weights for those pools\n\n\nAll of these approaches are restricted by the amount of capital that you personally have\n Your limit is the amount of CRV in your wallet\n Instead, what if you could aggregate the capital of many different people and deploy all of it? Then, your CRV acquisition power would be significantly larger\n And if there was an entirely new DeFi protocol built on top of Curve designed to maximize the amount of CRV captured, that might be a good place to deploy that aggregated capital\n\n\nConvex\n\nThis is what Convex Finance is as its core\n It is a DeFi protocol that collects Curve-related assets from individuals, and deploys them in various ways to acquire more CRV\n The name of the protocol invokes the image of a convex curve, which is defined by its increasingly “up-and-to-the-right” shape:\n\nA convex function\n\n\nThe Convex ecosystem is byzantine, with complex interrelationships between its various components\n These relationships can be self-referential and recursive, making them hard to untangle\n Below, we outline each part, with a particular eye to what the cost and benefits are to both the user and Convex\n\n\nCurve LP Token Staking\n\nSuppose you are already an LP for a pool on CRV\n That means you have that pool’s LP token in your wallet, and presumably, you’re earning some combination of trading fees + CRV rewards for providing liquidity\n The amount of CRV you’re gaining will depend on the pool, the amount your LPing, how much CRV you’ve locked up for veCRV, and whether you’ve boosted the gauge for that pool\n\n\nOne service that Convex offers is for users to convert their Curve LP tokens to Convex LP tokens, and then “stake” those converted LP tokens\n Here, “staking” means locking up those converted LP tokens in a smart contract for a duration of your choice - you can “unstake” at any point to get your LP tokens back\n Convex probably requires staking of these LP tokens to receive benefits so there is some hurdle to clear before you re-convert your Convex LP tokens for Curve LP tokens\n\n\nWhen you stake your converted Convex LP tokens, you receive the following benefits:\n\nThe base Curve trading fees you would have gotten as a Curve LP\n A portion of the CRV rewards you would have received if you were a fully boosted veCRV holder and CVX rewards\n (More on CVX below\n)\n\nThe MIM Curve pool\n\n\nConvex rewards for the MIM Curve pool\n\n\n1 is straightforward\n This is no different than directly being a Curve LP\n\n\n2 is interesting\n Again, the amount of CRV rewards you receive for being an LP depend on the pool, the number of LP tokens you have, the gauge weight, and the boost you get as a veCRV holder\n The maximum boost is 2\n5x\n\n\nBecause Convex Finance has a lot of veCRV, they can probably achieve the maximum boost on every pool\n On the other hand, you may not have enough veCRV to achieve the maximum boost\n Therefore, it would certainly be worth it for you to stake your LP tokens in Convex if your CRV rewards from staking LP tokens in Convex is greater than your CRV rewards from Curve after boosting with your veCRV\n\n\nIn the MIM example above:\n\nConvex gives its MIM LP stakers 8\n09% APY via CRV rewards\n\n\nA maximally boosted Curve MIM LP would get 13\n59% APY via CRV rewards\n\n\nThus, you should stake your LP tokens if your veCRV boost results in a less than 8\n09% APY in Curve rewards\n Moreover, this exchange is worth it to Convex because they can collect a portion of the CRV rewards they get as maximum boosters\n In the MIM example, this would be 13\n59% - 8\n09 % = 5\n5% APY\n This fact is displayed transparently to the user in the form of a 17% fee:\n\nConvex Fees\n\n\nLPing in the Convex \/ Curve ecosystem\n\n\nIn fact, it could be worth it to you to stake your LP tokens even if the CRV rewards you get from doing so are less than what you would get directly from Curve, because you are also receiving rewards in the form of CVX\n So, what is CVX?\n\nCVX\n\nAccording to Convex’s documentation, CVX is the “the native platform token for Convex Finance\n” This alone means relatively little\n What benefits does CVX have?\n\nStaking\n\nOne thing you can do with your CVX is to stake it, i\ne\n lock it up for a duration of your choice\n Convex wants you to do so so that the circulating supply of CVX is lowered\n\n\nIf you stake your CVX, then you will receive cvxCRV tokens as a reward\n (We will cover cvxCRV in a subsequent section\n I told you this was byzantine!) Recall that 5% of Convex’s 17% in fees are distributed to “CVX stakers & lockers” - this is that fee being returned to CVX stakers as a reward\n\n\nSo, staking CVX may be worth it to you if the discounted sum of future cvxCRV rewards you receive exceed the current CVX price\n Of course, both cvxCRV and CVX are volatile in price, so such a calculation may be difficult to do\n\n\nVote Locking\n\nThe other thing you can do with your CVX is to vote lock it\n This should sound familiar - it is the exact same mechanism provided on Curve to transform CRV into veCRV\n\n\nVote Locking on Convex Finance\n\n\nUnlike on Curve, where users can vote lock their CRV for any amount of time between 1 year and 4 years, vote locking CVX on Convex requires doing so for 16 weeks to the nearest Thursday\n If you vote lock your CVX, you are entitled to two benefits:\n\nGreater cvxCRV rewards than you would get from staking CVX\n For example, currently staking CVX results in a 3\n99% vAPR, while vote locking CVX results in a 4\n71% vAPR\n This makes sense because vote locking CVX is more inconvenient than staking CVX - you don’t have a say over when you can withdraw your CVX; you have to wait at least 16 weeks\n\n\nVoting rights to determine Convex’s voting on Curve pools\n Note that this is subject to some clamping rules to ensure the gauge weights that Convex assigns are neither too large nor too small\n Also, the actual mechanism through which Convex implements this is an admin multi-sig wallet that translates the Convex votes into Curve votes through a manual process\n Some might point to this as a potential point of failure\n\n\nBy vote locking your CVX, you receive the right to vote on how Convex will deploy its veCRV to vote on the gauge weights of the Curve pools\n What this has created is a “governance-on-governance” or “meta-governance” structure: you’re voting on voting\n Thus, if you believed that veCRV was valuable for its ability to determine how Curve allocates its CRV rewards (i\ne\n the gauge weights), it would make sense to believe that vote-locked CVX is also valuable for this reason\n\n\nCVX in the Convex \/ Curve ecosystem\n\n\ncvxCRV\n\nThe last piece of the Convex puzzle is cvxCRV\n\n\nIf you already have CRV, one thing you can do on Convex is to convert it to a different ERC-20 token called cvxCRV, and then stake it\n There is a 1:1 relationship between CRV and cvxCRV; if you have 100 CRV, you’ll receive 100 cvxCRV\n Once you convert your CRV to cvxCRV, you cannot convert it back; it is a one-way exchange\n\n\nWhen you stake your cvxCRV, you receive the following:\n\nAll of the additional Curve trading fees you would have gotten from being an equivalent veCRV holder\n Recall this comes out to 50% of Curve’s trading fees, and is paid out in Curve 3pool LP tokens\n A portion of 10% of the Convex LP’s CRV earnings Additional CVX rewards\n\nFor example, right now, staking cvxCRV leads to a 47\n57% vAPR, with 4\n46% of that coming from the Curve 3pool LP tokens, 17\n6% coming from CRV rewards, and 25\n51% coming from CVX rewards\n\n\nBy converting CRV to cvxCRV, you are giving up the ability to convert it to veCRV and vote on the Curve pools directly\n Once you stake your cvxCRV, you receive the Curve 3pool LP tokens you would have gotten as rewards as an equivalent veCRV holder, and additional rewards in the from CRV and CVX\n\n\ncvxCRV in the Convex \/ Curve ecosystem\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nIt is worth pointing out that staking\/vote-locking CVX results in cvxCRV rewards, and staking cvxCRV results in CVX rewards\n This type of circular dependency seems sketchy to me\n If I wanted to determine the value of a token like CVX, I would take the discounted future rewards that would accrue to CVX\n Part of those future rewards are in cvxCRV\n To determine the value of cvxCRV, I would try to perform the same calculation\n But part of cvxCRV’s future rewards are in CVX, leading to an infinite loop\n\n\nAt the very least, this reward structure makes it difficult to reason about how to value CVX and cvxCRV relative to each other\n Some might refer to these dynamics as “Ponzinomics\n”\n\nHowever, we have also established that the value proposition of CRV is a share of trading fees on the Curve platform, and the right to vote on the allocation of further CRV rewards for Curve pools\n In this original example, too, we noted the recursive nature of benefit accrual: acquire CRV to get more CRV\n In other words, the value of CRV is dependent on future CRV rewards, the value of which is dependent on the value of CRV\n\n\nIf anybody has a mathematical model that handles these recursions \/ circular dependencies, please DM them to me\n\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing this strategy, Convex Finance has successfully acquired about 47% of the outstanding veCRV, making them one of the most influential forces in the Curve wars\n\n\n0x989a\n\n corresponds to Convex Finance\n\n\nConvex participants (both CVX and cvxCRV stakers) benefit from the fees that Convex charges its Curve LP token stakers\n These fees are disbursed to cvxCRV stakers and CVX stakers\/vote-lockers in the form of base Curve rewards, cvxCRV, and CVX\n The exact value relationship between cvxCRV and CVX is hard to untangle given the recursive nature of their valuations, but if you view Curve governance and CRV as having significant value, then Convex has prevailed in becoming the predominant DeFi protocol in the Curve Wars\n."}
